Final Report:
1. Report.pdf

The files used for data cleaning are:
1. convert_file.py: program used to combine data set according to the project. Every 15 minute data was combined on hourly basis.
2. daily_data.py: program used to combine data in a way that it is on daily basis.
3. weekend_data.py: program used to generate 2 files, first a dataset with working days all round the year and second dataset for holidays and weekend.
4. DataCleaning.ipynb: program to remove unnecessary columns from files.
5. merging_data_files.ipynb: merges weather data and bicycle data together in single csv file.

Files used in project (needs to be uploaded file running the code): 
1. finalD.csv : used in Bicycle_count.pynb
2. daily_data.csv : used in daily_analysis.pynb
3. weekend_data.csv : used in daily_analysis.pynb
4. working_days_data.csv : used in daily_analysis.pynb

Final Project Files:
1. Bicycle_count.ipynb: contains parameter analysis, regression model selection, their r2 scores, accuracies and final model to predict bicycle count by inputting time and weather conditions. It also contains comparison of eastbound and westbound traffic on both streets.
2. daily_analysis.ipynb: contains daily analysis of bicycle trend based on weather and time, working and non working daya traffic analysis.
